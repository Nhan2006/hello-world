Introduce myself
------
My full name is Nhan Nguyen. I came to America five years ago from Vietnam. I loved here, the cultures and people, which is giving me a good enviroment. Playing sports is my favorite thing to do whenener I am free, especially soccer.
My goal education is finishing my AS-T Degree at Pierce College and transfer to WSU to achieve the Bachelor's Degree of Mechanical Engineering. 

Technical Writing
------
In my thought, when I heared about Technical Writing, it is just all about coding as I need to learn lots of computer language. However, my thought was not wrong but not right enough. After reading the artical in class, I realized that Technical Writing is organizing information.

Github
------
I did not know about Github until I attended to this Technical Writing. This is my first time working with Github, I can tell this is a good program that everyone should know. To using this one, it will take only a few easy steps to sign up. I did read the lesson "Hello World Github Guide" to help me get use to this program and know how to creating projects.
